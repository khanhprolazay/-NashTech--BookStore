          <p>
              The name BookWorm was taken from the original name for New York international Airport, which was renamed JFK in December 1963.

              Our Vision
          </h5>
          <p>
              One of the last travel bookstore in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of guidebooks (all 10% off) to suit the needs and tastes of every traveler and budget.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook, and our well-read, well-traveled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any traveller, book lover, or gift giver.
