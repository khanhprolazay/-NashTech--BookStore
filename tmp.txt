Wellcome to Bookworm
Bookworm is an independent New York bookstore and language scholl with locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. We specialize in traval books and laguage classes.

Out Story
The name BookWorm was taken from the original name for New York international Airport, which was renamed JFK in December 1963.
Our Manhattan store has just moved to the West Village. Our new locations is 170 7th Avenue South, at the corner of Perry Street.
From March 2008 though May 2016, the store was located in the Flatiron District.

Our Vision
One of the last travel bookstore in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of guidebooks (all 10% off) to suit the needs and tastes of every traveler and budget.
We believe that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook, and our well-read, well-traveled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any traveller, book lover, or gift giver.
